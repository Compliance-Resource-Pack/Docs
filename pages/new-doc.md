# How to write a new documentation article

You can add a new article ba creating a new file in the pages directory or any of its subdirectories.
Please only use markdown files and do not change anything on the existing HTML, CSS or JavaScript.

## Front Matter

The article needs a front matter to get recognized automatically.
It has to be the first thing in the file and defines the title of your article.
Below you can see an example.
```yaml
---
title: 'Your title here'
---
```
