# Add textures to an **existing** Mod:

## Prerequisites:

> You need to have a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account first.
> You **need** to have downloaded [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for easier file and branch management.

1.  Firstly find your Mod repository in our organization, then clone it by clicking the green button `Code` and selecting `Open with GitHub Desktop`.

2.  Select a file path to clone it on your computer (you can place it everywhere)

3.  Then select the branch version for which you want to add textures (if the branch doesn't exist yet, see [here](/help-us/add-new-version)). Your local repository will update itself to the branch content (it has the content of the `main` branch by default → if you cloned the repository from the main branch).

4.  Then go to your local repository folder and move your new/changed files in the `assets` folder (like in the default resource pack).

5.  When you have placed all new files into the `assets` file, go back to GitHub Desktop and you will see all new files on the left tab:

    ![(-)](https://i.imgur.com/td27NCr.png) File deleted
    ![(→)](https://i.imgur.com/qZbsYi5.png) File location has changed

6.  You can now add a title and a description to your commit (on the bottom left in GitHub Desktop) and press `Commit to < branch >`.

7.  Finally: click on the `Push origin` button to send your commit to GitHub. You can now make a post in our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/QF2CAX7) to make an annoucement about what you changed!
